# Digital-Design-Projects
Set of my digital design projects



## List

* IIR_Filter: Verilog implementation of IIR Filter in fixed-point representation
* PWL_Caos: Verilog implementation of a chaotic system using piecewise-linear (PWL)
* Remote_Control: VDHL implementation of a system that captures the signal of  remote control and then produces a sound in a custom board(PCB files included), the system has developed in ISE14.04.
* RISC_IA: Verilog Implementation of a tiny-RISC processor (***project under development)***
